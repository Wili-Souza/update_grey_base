A web-scraper for grey literature that accepts a search string and exports the extrated data in a csv and xlsx file.
By: Wiliane Souza

Python version: 3.7.9

## Libs you'll need 
* pandas
* xlsxwriter
* beautifulsoup4
* requests
* selenium
  
Obs.: You will also need to install chromedriver
and maybe replace the executable in the folder with yours.


## syntax
When running the MAIN file, it will ask for a string, make sure you put the correct syntax:

* Valid operators are: OR and AND
* Order of precedence: AND, then OR (use parentheses to change it)
* put your keywords in quotes, e.g.: "Apple", "Apple Sauce"
* Don't forget the spaces between your expressions:

* Wrong -> ("Apple"OR"Apple Souce)AND"Mashed Potatoes"
* Right -> ("Apple" OR "Apple Souce) AND "Mashed Potatoes"
  
 Obs.: It does not accept strings with parentheses in parentheses yet
      e.g.: (("Apple" OR "Pie") AND "Apple Souce) OR "Honey"
      you can use instead: ("Apple" OR "Pie") AND "Apple Souce OR "Honey"
 
 Using a wrong syntax may cause errors or wrong results.
